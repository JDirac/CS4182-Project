4 headings split across 4 people. Try do 800 to 1000 words for each heading.

   1. What is EUV? - Jonathan (Completed)
   
      Physics behind EUV - Jonathan (completed)

   2. History of EUVâ€™s development? - Denis (completed)

   3. Why is EUV important? - Bryan

   4. What significance will EUV have for the future of our technology? - Kacper
   
   It may be difficult to write 1000 words on a specific heading, so more may be added if necessary.
   Such headings could include "The Physics Behind EUV", etc.

Whenever you finish a section of your report, just upload the file into the folder I've created for you

There will also need to be a poster created fro this project. Myself and Dneis have more or less completed our sections of the report,
so we can make a start on the poster.
